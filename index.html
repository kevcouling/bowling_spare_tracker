  -where the spare hasn't been recorded before: "This is your first attempt at 2-4-5: Good Luck!" and leave all fields blank. 
  -where the spare has been attempted before and Success is greater than zero "Your best result is [Highest Success value]%. Here's how you did it:" then prefill the following fields with data from the highest Success rate attempt.

     -Standing Board 
     -Target at Arrow 
     -Target Pin
